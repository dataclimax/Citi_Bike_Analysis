Overview:

I will be analyzing a Citi Bike database using SQL and python. Since I from NY, I decided to look at this data and just do an overall analysis with the data provided and see what questions I can answer.

This notebook contains an in depth explanation of the result behind the analysis and reasoning behind the strategies I use within each project.

This is all about data analysis to find interesting insights about the use of citibikes.
I wanted to continue practicing with SQL language while also using python.
